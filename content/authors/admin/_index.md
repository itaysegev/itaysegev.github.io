#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the Technion, specializing in Deep Reinforcement Learning. My research focuses on developing novel multi-objective safe and robust RL algorithms for complex estimation tasks, particularly in Smart Energy Networks. I'm interested in developing robust and efficient learning algorithms and applying them to challenging real-world tasks that can make a meaningful impact.
